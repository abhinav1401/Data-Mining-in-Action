# Data Mining in Action
This project involves building KNN, Decision Tree Learner, and Random Forest Learner classifiers to predict the Qualified status of the housing property. The dataset is present on Kaggle at this link --

Two data sets used are, ‘TrainingSet.csv’ and ‘TestingSet.csv’. ‘TrainingSet’ is the dataset that will be fed to the classifier to build a predictive model and ‘TestingSet’ is the dataset for which the class attribute value (QUALIFIED) is predicted. The ‘TrainingSet’ contains 75008 rows and 39 attributes. The ‘TestingSet’ contains 32148 rows and 38 attributes. The additional attribute that the ‘TrainingSet’ has is the class attribute, which is utilized to build the classifier model and estimate the classifier’s accuracy.
